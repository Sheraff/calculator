/**
 * This hook allows you to access a state from within another
 * hook without having to pass it as a dependency (with `stateRef`)
 * while still using the state normally as well (`state, setState`)
 *
 * âš  the downside is that `setState` and `stateRef` need to be passed
 * as dependencies to other hooks (for the linter to be happy)
 * but they remain stable and don't trigger the effects
 * (same as a normal useState or useRef)

 * @template T
 * @param {T} initial
 * @returns {[
 * 	T,
 * 	React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<T>>,
 * 	React.MutableRefObject<T>
